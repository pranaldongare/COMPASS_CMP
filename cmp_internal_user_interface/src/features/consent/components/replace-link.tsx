/**
 * Replacing a consent link.
 *
 * The links list already had a "New link" button, and it did something subtly
 * wrong: it minted a *second* link for the site and left the first one live. A
 * site then had two working URLs, one of which nobody was tracking — which is
 * exactly the situation the register exists to prevent.
 *
 * Replacing does both halves in one transaction: the old link is revoked, a new
 * one is issued with the same expiry and use limit, and the old row stays in the
 * register with its use count so the trail still says when it stopped working.
 *
 * This is also the answer to "the link is not visible anywhere". It cannot be —
 * the database holds a keyed digest, so the URL is unrecoverable by design — and
 * the honest operation is a fresh link rather than a weaker store.
