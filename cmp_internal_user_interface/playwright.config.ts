 * API is on `127.0.0.1:8000`; the console is opened at `localhost:3000`.
 * Browsers treat those as **different sites** for cookie purposes, so a session
 * cookie set `SameSite=Lax` is silently dropped on the next XHR — login returns
 * 200 and the following request is a 401, with nothing in either log to say
 * why.
 *
 * The `/api` rewrite in `next.config.ts` is what fixes it, by making the API
 * same-origin. Testing only on `127.0.0.1` would not have caught the original
 * bug and would not catch its return, because on that host the two names agree.
 * So the same specs run against `localhost` too, and if somebody removes the
 * rewrite the auth spec fails here rather than in somebody's browser.
