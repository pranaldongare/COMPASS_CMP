/**
 * Reaching the notice upload as the person who has to use it.
 *
 * This exists because the control was built, wired and tested at every layer
 * below the screen — the endpoints worked, the parser worked, the dialog
 * worked — and an R&D User still could not find it. The page header carried the
 * button among several others, while the card that said "No notice yet" offered
 * nothing to click. Every unit test passed the whole time.
 *
 * So the assertion here is deliberately about *reachability from the empty
 * state*, not about whether the button exists somewhere on the page. A control
 * that exists but that nobody looking for it will find is not a control.
