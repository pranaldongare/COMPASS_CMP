/**
 * Signing in, proving a second factor, and managing one's own credentials.
 *
 * Two things about this module are deliberate and easy to undo by accident.
 *
 * **No response here says whether an account exists.** The API answers
 * identically for a wrong password and an unknown login, and for a code sent to
 * a registered contact and one that is not. Nothing in this file should start
 * distinguishing them in a return type or an error branch, because that puts
 * the distinction back into the client where an attacker can read it.
 *
 * **The session never appears in JavaScript.** It arrives as an HttpOnly
 * cookie, is sent by the browser, and is not readable here — which is why there
 * is no `getToken` and no place to put one.
