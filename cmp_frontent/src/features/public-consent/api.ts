/**
 * The public consent flow — the four steps a data principal actually walks.
 *
 * This is the only feature reachable without a session, and the most carefully
 * specified surface in the system. Three properties are load-bearing:
 *
 * **An invalid link never says why.** Expired, revoked, exhausted and mistyped
 * all resolve to the same failure. Naming the reason would tell somebody
 * guessing tokens which of their guesses was structurally valid.
 *
 * **`served_at` is server-stamped and echoed back untouched.** It is what
 * evidences s.5(1) — that the notice was given *before* consent was asked for —
 * and a client-supplied timestamp would make that unfalsifiable.
 *
 * **Accept and decline take the same path.** s.6(1) requires consent to be a
 * free choice, and a decline that is slower, harder or routed differently is
 * not a free choice. `recordConsent` handles both.
