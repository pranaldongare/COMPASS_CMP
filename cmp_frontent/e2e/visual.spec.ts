/**
 * Visual regression.
 *
 * The gap these close is narrow and real: a token renamed in `styles/`, a
 * utility class dropped in a refactor, a component that stops respecting dark
 * mode. None of that fails a type check, a lint or a behavioural test — the
 * button is still a button and still calls the right endpoint. It is just
 * invisible, or unreadable, or the wrong colour.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately small. Every screenshot is a file somebody has to
 * review on every change that touches it, so this covers the surfaces where a
 * regression would be *seen by somebody outside the organisation* — the sign-in
 * page and the public consent flow — plus the two states of the design system
 * itself. Screenshotting fifteen console list pages would produce a suite
 * people approve without looking, which is worse than not having one.
 *
 * ## Updating a baseline
 *
 *     npx playwright test --project=visual --update-snapshots
 *
 * Then look at the diff before committing it. A baseline updated without
 * looking is a test deleted.
 *
 * ## When one fails on a different machine
 *
 * Font rendering and anti-aliasing differ between platforms. `maxDiffPixelRatio`
 * in the config absorbs the noise; a failure above it is a real change. If a
 * baseline was captured on a different OS from CI's, regenerate it there rather
 * than raising the threshold.

/**
 * Serial, and for a measured reason rather than a cautious one.
 *
 * Run alone, these pass every time. Run with four parallel workers against a
 * dev server, the `rights` capture failed roughly one run in five — four
 * browsers competing for one Turbopack process delays a lazily-loaded chunk
 * past the settle check, and the screenshot catches the page one paint early.
 *
 * That is a measurement of the machine, not of the stylesheet. Raising the diff
 * threshold to absorb it would blind the suite to real changes; running these
 * one at a time removes the cause. Seven screenshots do not need to be
 * parallel.

/**
 * Wait for the page to stop moving before capturing it.

 * Each step here is a source of flake that was observed rather than guessed at.
 * The last one is the important one: `fullPage` measures the document at the
 * instant it fires, and a page still hydrating is still viewport-height. That
 * produced a `rights` baseline of 1280×1312 and captures of 1280×800 on
 * roughly two runs in three — a size mismatch, which reads as a total diff and
 * tells you nothing about what changed.
