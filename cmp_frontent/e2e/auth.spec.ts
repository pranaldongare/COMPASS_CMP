/**
 * End-to-end: the session, and the boundaries around it.
 *
 * This file exists mostly for one bug, and it is worth stating plainly because
 * it cost a day and left no trace in either log.
 *
 * The API runs on `127.0.0.1:8000`. Somebody opens the console at
 * `localhost:3000`. Those are **different sites** to a browser, so the session
 * cookie — set `SameSite=Lax`, correctly — is dropped on the next XHR. Sign-in
 * returns 200. The request immediately after returns 401. The server log shows
 * a successful login followed by an unauthenticated request, and the browser
 * shows a sign-in page that just accepted the password.
 *
 * The `/api` rewrite in `next.config.ts` fixes it by making the API
 * same-origin, and it looks like an optimisation to anybody reading the config
 * without this context — which is exactly how it would get removed.
 *
 * So this spec runs in the `localhost-cookies` project as well as the default
 * one, and on that host it is the regression test for the rewrite. On
 * `127.0.0.1` the two names agree and it would pass either way.
 *
 * Credentials come from the environment; the tests skip without them rather
 * than fail, because a suite that goes red for a missing fixture trains people
 * to ignore red.
