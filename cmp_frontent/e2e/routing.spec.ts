/**
 * Routing an approved project, driven through the screens.
 *
 * The API tests prove the rules. What they cannot prove is that somebody can
 * *reach* them: the DCO Admin's whole job is two screens — make somebody
 * accountable for a source, then attach that source to a site — and either one
 * being unreachable leaves an approved project stalled with nothing on screen
 * saying why.
 *
 * Serial, because these authenticate against a rate-limited API and the second
 * half depends on what the first half set up.
