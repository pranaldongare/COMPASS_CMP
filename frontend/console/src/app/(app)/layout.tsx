/**
 * Layout for every authenticated page.
 *
 * `RequireAuth` renders nothing until the session resolves, so a protected page
 * never flashes its contents before redirecting. A flash of a project list is a
 * disclosure, however brief.
 *
 * `RequireSection` is the second gate, and answers a different question:
 * authenticated *as whom*. The sidebar only offers what a role may use, which
 * held until something outside the sidebar produced a URL — a notification
 * linking a data principal to `/users` did exactly that. Neither gate is a
 * security boundary; the permission matrix on the server is. These stop the
 * product showing somebody a console that will refuse them.
