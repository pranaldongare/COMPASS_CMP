**164 endpoints** — 93 GET · 53 POST · 12 PUT · 4 DELETE · 2 PATCH — across **15 areas**, over **25 tables**.

## 2. How access is decided

Two things gate every request, and they are separate on purpose.

**The role gate** is a FastAPI dependency, named in the endpoint signature. It
answers *may this kind of user call this endpoint at all* and produces 403.

**Row scope** is a SQL predicate compiled into the `WHERE` clause of the query
itself — never a filter applied to rows already fetched. It answers *which rows
does this user have*, and its failure is **404, not 403**: telling somebody a
project exists but is not theirs confirms it exists to anyone probing uuids.

| Gate | Endpoints | Means |
|---|---:|---|
| `unauthenticated` | 22 | No session. Health probes, public consent pages, `/meta`. |
| `CurrentUser` | 21 | Any signed-in user; the endpoint scopes rows itself. |
| `ProjectReader` | 20 | Any role that may see projects, narrowed by row scope. |
| `RequireDataSubject` | 12 | The data principal's own surface only. |
| `NoticeAuthor` | 10 | DPO anywhere, R&D User on their own projects. |
| `RequireDPOorAdmin` | 9 | DPO or platform administrator. |
| `RequireDPO` | 9 | The Data Protection Officer alone. |
| `NoticeReader` | 9 | Anyone who may read the notice. |
| `RequireAdmin` | 7 | Platform administrator alone. |
| `LinkReader` | 6 | Roles that may see consent links. |
| `ConsentReader` | 6 | Roles that may see consent artefacts. |
| `CollectionReader` | 6 | Roles that may see collections and assets. |
| `ExportReader` | 5 | Roles that may see exports. |
| `data source, write` | 4 | Write access to a specific data source. |
| `RequireStaff` | 3 | Any internal staff role, derived from the matrix. |
| `processor, write` | 3 | Write access to a specific processor. |
| `ImportActor` | 3 | Roles that may submit a manifest. |
| `PartialUser` | 2 | A half-authenticated session, mid-MFA. |
| `ReadRegistry` | 2 | Read the processor / source / purpose registry. |
| `processor, read` | 2 | Read access to a specific processor. |
| `data source, read` | 2 | Read access to a specific data source. |
| `ExportActor` | 1 | Roles that may generate an export. |

## 3. CRUD by entity

Grouped by the tables each area owns. `C`/`R`/`U`/`D` mark which operations the
HTTP surface actually exposes — several tables are deliberately **read-only over**
**HTTP** and written only by the domain or a trigger.

**Generated from three sources**, and reproducible from them:

| Section | Read from |
|---|---|
| Endpoints and gates | the FastAPI application object — `app.routes`, walked through the included routers, taking each endpoint's `principal` annotation as the gate |
| Tables and columns | the PostgreSQL catalogue — `pg_tables` and `information_schema.columns` |
| File trees | the working tree, with generated and secret-bearing paths excluded |

Because the route table is read from the application object rather than from the
source, it cannot disagree with what the server actually serves. Row counts come
from the development database and are indicative only.
