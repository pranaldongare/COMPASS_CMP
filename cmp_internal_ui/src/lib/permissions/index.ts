/**
 * What the current user may see, client-side.
 *
 * **This is not access control.** Say it plainly, because the shape of the code
 * invites the opposite reading: it is a function called `can()` that returns a
 * boolean, and it would be very easy for somebody to conclude that guarding a
 * mutation with it is sufficient. It is not, and it never will be — anything
 * running in a browser is under the user's control.
 *
 * What it is for is **not offering an action that will fail**. A button that
 * 403s when pressed is a worse experience than a button that is not there, and
 * it teaches people to distrust the interface.
 *
 * The rules are not duplicated here. `me.nav` comes from the server, computed
 * from the same permission matrix the API enforces with, so this module reads a
 * server answer rather than re-deriving one. The moment it re-derives, it drifts
 * — and drifts silently, because any test would be written against the copy.
