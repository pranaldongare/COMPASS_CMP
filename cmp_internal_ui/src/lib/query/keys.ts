/**
 * Every query key in the console, in one place.
 *
 * This file exists so invalidation can be *reasoned about* rather than
 * remembered. When a mutation succeeds it has to invalidate every cached view
 * the write affected, and the failure mode is not a crash — it is a screen that
 * quietly shows the old number. The usual "fix" is a page reload, which hides
 * the bug rather than removing it.
 *
 * Two properties make that reliable:
 *
 * **Keys are grouped by domain, and the group prefix is shared.** Every project
 * key starts `["project", uuid, ...]`, so `invalidateQueries({ queryKey:
 * keys.project.detail(uuid) })` reaches the detail, its summary, its history,
 * its transitions, its approvals and its sites in one call — TanStack matches
 * on key prefix. Getting the prefixes right is what makes that work; a key of
 * `["project-summary", uuid]` would look similar and invalidate nothing.
 *
 * **Filters are part of the key, always last.** `["projects", {status: "open"}]`
 * and `["projects", {}]` are different cached lists, which is correct — they
 * hold different rows. Invalidating `["projects"]` reaches both.
 *
 * `as const` throughout so the tuples stay literal types and a typo in a key
 * segment is a compile error rather than a cache miss nobody notices.
