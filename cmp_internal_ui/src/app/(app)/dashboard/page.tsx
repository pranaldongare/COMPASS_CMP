/**
 * The dashboard.
 *
 * One endpoint, role-aware. The response shape differs by role but the call does
 * not, so there is one loading path here rather than five components each
 * fetching something different.
 *
 * The work queues matter more than the counts. A DPO opening this page needs to
 * know what is waiting for *her*, not how many projects exist — so the queues
 * sit above the fold and the figures support them.
 *
 * On the charts: a count that a chart already explains is not repeated as a
 * tile. The project lifecycle is a magnitude comparison across named stages, so
 * it is a one-hue bar list; the consent position is part-to-whole, so it is a
 * single direct-labelled stacked bar. Nothing here is a pie, and nothing is a
 * one-bar bar chart pretending a number needs a plot.
