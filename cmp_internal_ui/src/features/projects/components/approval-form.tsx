/**
 * Recording an approval and its proof.
 *
 * The upload is what unblocks `in_draft -> pending_approval`, so the
 * mutation invalidates the transition view as well as the approval list.
 * Without that the user uploads a document and the button they were trying to
 * unblock stays disabled.
 *
 * **The proof is part of the form, not beside it.** It was held in component
 * state while `approvalSchema` listed it as required, so every submit validated
 * `proof: undefined`, failed, and returned — the button did nothing, and no
 * control was bound to `errors.proof` so nothing said why. A form that fails
 * silently is worse than one that fails loudly: there is nothing to read and
 * nothing to search for.
 *
 * So the file goes through `setValue` with `shouldValidate`, which means the
 * schema is the single authority on whether this approval is complete, and the
 * size and type rules in `fileSchema(PROOF)` are actually applied rather than
 * being a second copy of what `FileInput` checks.
