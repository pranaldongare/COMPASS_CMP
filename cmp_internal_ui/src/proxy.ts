/**
 * The proxy — the first thing that touches a request.
 *
 * Named `proxy.ts` because Next 16 renamed the convention; `middleware.ts` still
 * works and prints a deprecation warning on every build. The export below keeps
 * the framework's expected name.
 *
 * Two jobs, and it is important to be clear about what each one is *for*:
 *
 * 1. **Content Security Policy with a per-request nonce.** This cannot be a
 *    static header in `next.config.ts`, because a nonce that never changes is
 *    not a nonce. It has to be minted per request and handed to the document.
 *
 * 2. **A cheap redirect for a request carrying no session cookie.** This is
 *    *not* the authorisation check and must never be mistaken for one — the
 *    cookie is HttpOnly, so all this can see is whether one is present, not
 *    whether it is valid, unexpired, or belongs to somebody permitted. The API
 *    decides that, on every request, and answers 401/403/404 accordingly.
 *
 *    What it buys is the flash: without it, a signed-out visitor pointed at
 *    `/projects` downloads the page, renders a skeleton, calls the API, gets a
 *    401 and only then bounces. With it, they never receive the page at all.
 *
 * The rule to hold on to: **the client is not a security boundary.** Everything
 * here is a courtesy to the honest user and a speed bump for everyone else. The
 * boundary is the API.

 * `<script>` without the nonce does not run, whatever the injection point.
 *
