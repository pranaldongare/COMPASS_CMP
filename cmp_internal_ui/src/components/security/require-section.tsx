/**
 * A page a role has no business on does not render.
 *
 * The sidebar is built from `me.nav`, so a role is never *offered* a section it
 * cannot use. That was the whole guard, and it held exactly as long as every
 * route into the app came from the sidebar. A notification linking to
 * `/users` — which is what a data principal's own registration event resolved
 * to — walked straight past it, and she arrived at the administrator's account
 * register: the API refused every request underneath, so the screen was empty,
 * but it was the admin screen and it had her on it.
 *
 * The link is fixed at the source. This is the second half: whatever produced
 * the URL, the page behind it is not for her.
 *
 * **It is not a security boundary and must not be read as one.** Every one of
 * these routes is enforced server-side by the permission matrix, and that is
 * what actually protects the data. This exists so the product does not show
 * somebody a console that will refuse them — a different problem, and one the
 * server cannot solve because by then the page has already rendered.
 *
 * The permitted set comes from `me.nav`, which the server computes. Not a
 * second list of who-may-see-what: a hardcoded one would drift from the matrix,
 * and the drift would show up as either a locked-out user or exactly the hole
 * this closes.
