"""The names routes actually write.

Every guard in this package composed into the annotated types a route signature
uses. A route says what it needs and gets it:

    async def list_projects(principal: ProjectReader, page: Paged) -> ...:

Collected here rather than defined beside each guard so that a reader can see
the whole vocabulary of route requirements in one screen — and so adding a new
one is a deliberate act in a file whose diff gets read.
