"""What a route asks for.

Split by concern rather than by endpoint, because these are the security
boundary and each one should be readable on its own:

    sessions        cookie -> Session, and the two cookies we set
    csrf            the double-submit check, and why it is only on unsafe verbs
    authentication  Session -> Principal; full, partial and optional
    authorization   the route guards: RequireRole and RequireResource
    pagination      cursor, limit and the per-route sort allow-list
    filters         unknown query parameters are refused, never ignored
    common          the annotated aliases a route signature actually writes

Routes import from `common`. The rest is what `common` is made of.

Nothing here opens a transaction. A guard that wrote an audit row would be doing
it outside the transaction the service is about to start, so denials are audited
by the layer that has the connection.
