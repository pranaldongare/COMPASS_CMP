"""Flagging assets with unmapped subjects.

The control that makes direct collection workable. The dangerous outcome is never
a rejected import — that is obvious and gets fixed. It is 500 assets declared,
480 mapped, and twenty sitting in an unlawful state nobody is looking at.

Runs every six hours: often enough that a gap is found the same working day,
rarely enough that it is not competing with collection.
