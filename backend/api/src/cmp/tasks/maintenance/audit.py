"""Verifying the hash chain.

Recomputes every row digest and reports the first that does not verify. Daily,
because the value of an append-only trail is entirely in being able to say it has
not been tampered with — and a claim nobody checks is a claim nobody should
believe.

The answer is deliberately positional: not "something changed" but "the trail is
sound up to exactly here". That is what makes it actionable.
