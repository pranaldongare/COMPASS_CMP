"""The project lifecycle.

A project is the unit everything else hangs off: notices belong to it, sites
belong to it, consent is given against its notice, and exports come out of it.

`state_machine.py` is the specification - a pure function over five states with
no I/O, which is why it carries the densest test file in the suite. `service.py`
is the only place `project.project_status` is written, and every write goes
through `validate()` first, records a history row, and writes an audit row in the
same transaction. A project can never be in a state its history does not explain.
