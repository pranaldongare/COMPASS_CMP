"""Rate limiting, account lockout and distributed locks.

Rate limits are on the public surface, where there is no session to hold anyone
accountable (API reference §1.6):

    POST /c/{token}/otp         5 per hour per contact, 20 per hour per token
    POST /c/{token}/otp/verify  5 per code, then the code is discarded
    POST /auth/login            5 per 30 min per account (R-AUT-03 lockout)
    GET  /c/{token}             60 per minute per IP

Sliding window, not fixed: a fixed window lets an attacker send the full quota at
59.9s and again at 60.1s, which is twice the limit in a fifth of a second. The
sorted-set implementation costs one round trip and gets the arithmetic right.

**Failure behaviour is explicit.** If Redis is unavailable, a rate limiter that
fails open removes the control exactly when the system is already degraded, and
one that fails closed turns a cache outage into a total outage. So the caller
decides, per limiter, and the default for authentication is closed.
