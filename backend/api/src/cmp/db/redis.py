"""Redis client.

Used deliberately, for four things and no others (checklist §10):

* **Celery brokering** - a separate database index, so a `FLUSHDB` on the cache
  cannot silently discard queued work.
* **Sessions** - see `cmp.domain.sessions`. Deliberately not a database table:
  the 22 tables of DATA-MODEL.md are the record of what happened, and a session
  is not that. It is ephemeral state with a TTL, and it must disappear on its own
  when nobody comes back for it.
* **OTP and lockout counters** - short-lived by definition, and a counter that
  survives a restart is a counter that locks people out for the wrong reasons.
* **Locks and rate limits** - see `cmp.domain.ratelimit`.

Failure behaviour is explicit rather than incidental. Redis being unavailable
must not be the reason a consent artefact fails to write, but it also must not
silently disable a rate limit. Each caller states which it wants.
