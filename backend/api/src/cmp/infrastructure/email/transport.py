"""Where an email actually goes.

One protocol, three implementations, chosen by configuration. The point of the
seam is that everything above it — the templates, the tasks, the retry policy —
is written once and does not change when the transport does.

Whatever a deployment plugs in here must keep four properties, and they are
properties of the *transport*, not of the caller:

* **An explicit timeout.** Never infinite. A hung SMTP connection holds a worker
  slot until somebody notices, and nobody notices.
* **No secret in the log.** The code being delivered is never logged — that is
  the entire point of storing it as a keyed hash — and the recipient is
  obscured. What is logged is that a delivery happened, to roughly whom.
* **Raise on failure.** The Celery task carries the retry policy. A transport
  that swallows an error and returns quietly turns a retryable outage into
  silent data loss.
* **Idempotence is not assumed.** `acks_late` means a task can be redelivered,
  so a transport must tolerate being asked to send the same message twice.
