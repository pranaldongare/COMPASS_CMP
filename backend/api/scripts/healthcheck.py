"""Is this deployment actually working?

Not the same question as `/health`, which says the process is up, or `/ready`,
which says its dependencies answer. This checks the things that are *configured
correctly but silently wrong* — the failures that do not show up until somebody
needs the system to have been working all along.

Run it after a deploy, and on a schedule if you want the audit chain checked
outside Celery.

    uv run python scripts/healthcheck.py
    uv run python scripts/healthcheck.py --json

Exit code is 0 if everything passed, 1 if anything failed. Safe to run against
production: it reads, and writes nothing.
