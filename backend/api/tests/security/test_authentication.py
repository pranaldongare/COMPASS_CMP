"""Authentication — OWASP API2.

The properties asserted here are the ones whose absence is invisible until
somebody exploits them. A sign-in that works is not evidence that any of these
hold; each has to be checked on its own.

Two populations, and the difference is deliberate. Staff have a password.
**Data subjects have none** — `password_hash` is nullable for exactly that
reason — and sign in with a one-time code. A data subject who could set a
password would be an account worth phishing; one who receives a code per
sign-in has nothing worth stealing between sessions.
