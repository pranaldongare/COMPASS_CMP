"""Mass assignment — OWASP API3 / API6.

The failure: a request model that accepts more than the endpoint meant to offer,
so a caller sets a field nobody intended them to set. The classic is
`{"role": "admin"}` on a profile update.

Two structural defences, both asserted here:

* **Requests forbid unknown fields.** `Schema` sets `extra="forbid"`, so an
  unexpected key is a 422 rather than a silent no-op. Silence is the dangerous
  outcome — the caller cannot tell whether the field was applied.
* **Responses ignore unknown fields.** `Out` sets `extra="ignore"`, which is the
  *opposite* setting and deliberately so: repository rows carry internal columns,
  and `response_model` filtering is what strips them. Forbidding extras there
  would turn that filtering into a 500 and tempt somebody to "fix" it by widening
  the model until the integer id ships to the browser.

The third test class is the one that matters most in this system: **no integer
primary key may appear in any response model.** A sequential id tells the reader
how many rows exist and lets them walk the neighbours.
