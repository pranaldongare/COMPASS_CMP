"""Rate limiting and account lockout.

Three surfaces need bounding, for three different reasons:

* **Sign-in.** Unbounded attempts is password guessing at leisure. Bounded on the
  *account* rather than the address, because an attacker rotates addresses and a
  legitimate user behind a corporate NAT should not be locked out by a
  colleague's typo.
* **One-time codes.** A six-digit code is a million possibilities, which is a lot
  for a human and not many for a script. The verify attempt cap is what makes the
  code strong enough; the request cap is what stops the SMS bill being somebody
  else's problem.
* **The public consent link.** Unauthenticated and enumerable in principle. Bounded
  per address, because there is no account to bound on.

All three are Redis-backed rather than per-process. A counter in process memory
is not a rate limit when there are four workers — it is a limit four times looser
than it claims, and nobody notices until the fifth worker is added.
