"""Shared fixtures.

Two tiers of test, and the split is deliberate:

* **Unit** - pure functions. No database, no Redis, no event loop juggling. These
  run in milliseconds and are where the transition table, the permission matrix
  and the crypto primitives are pinned down.

* **Integration** (`-m integration`) - the real PostgreSQL and the real Redis.
  Marked, so `pytest -m "not integration"` still works on a machine with neither.
  They are not optional in CI: the constraints in migration 0002 are enforcement,
  and enforcement that is only tested against a mock is enforcement nobody has
  tested. The empty-array CHECK bug in 0004 was found this way and could not have
  been found any other way.

Each integration test runs inside a transaction that is rolled back afterwards,
so tests neither see nor leave each other's rows.
