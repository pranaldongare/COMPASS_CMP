"""The permission matrix says what it looks like it says.

A dict literal with the same key twice is legal Python. The later entry wins and
nothing warns, so a resource row can carry two grants for one role and the
weaker one silently decides. That is not a hypothetical: mirroring the DCO's
grants onto two new roles added a second `data_source` entry for `dco_admin`
underneath an existing write grant, and the effect was a role that could not
register the sources its whole job consists of registering. Nothing failed - the
matrix simply meant something other than what it read as.

The interpreter cannot catch it, because by the time the module is imported the
duplicate is already gone. So this reads the source instead.
