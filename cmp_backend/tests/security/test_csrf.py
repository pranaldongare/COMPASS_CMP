"""Cross-site request forgery.

The session cookie is HttpOnly, which is right — script cannot read it, so an XSS
bug cannot exfiltrate it. The cost is that the browser attaches it to *any*
request to this origin, including one triggered by a form on a site the user did
not expect to be acting on their behalf. That is the whole of CSRF.

The defence is a second token that has to arrive two ways: as a cookie the page
can read, and as a header the page had to set deliberately. A cross-site attacker
can cause the cookie to be sent but cannot read it to copy into the header,
because the same-origin policy stops them.

Two properties are asserted here, and both have been got wrong in real systems:

* the comparison is **constant time**, so it cannot be walked a byte at a time;
* an absent, empty or whitespace token **fails closed**, rather than an empty
  string comparing equal to an empty stored value.
