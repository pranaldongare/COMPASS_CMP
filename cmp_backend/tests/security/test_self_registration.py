"""Data-subject self-registration, and the date of birth it captures.

Sign-up is the only endpoint on this platform that creates an account without an
authenticated caller, which makes it the one place two failures are cheap to
introduce and expensive to find.

**Role escalation.** A body that carries a role, on an unauthenticated endpoint,
is how a sign-up form mints a DPO. The service writes the role itself; these
tests assert that a caller cannot influence it.

**Account enumeration.** A consent register's user list is close to "who is in
this study". A sign-up that answers differently for a known address turns the
form into a membership oracle, so registering an existing contact must be
indistinguishable from registering a new one.

The date of birth is not a profile field here. Section 9 of the DPDP Act treats
a person under eighteen as a child and requires verifiable parental consent, so
`dob` is the input to a statutory test - and `is_minor` being NULL for an unknown
date, rather than False, is the difference between "we do not know" and "we
checked and they are an adult".
