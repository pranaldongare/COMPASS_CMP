"""Naming somebody for one site, without moving the rig.

The override exists because reassigning the data source was the only way to say
"somebody else runs this campus on this project" - and it said far more than
that. Every project collecting from the same rig moved with it, silently, as a
side effect of a decision about one of them.

So most of what follows is a negative property: naming somebody here changes
this site, this project, and nothing else. That is the part which is invisible
from the screen where the decision is made, and therefore the part worth
pinning down.
