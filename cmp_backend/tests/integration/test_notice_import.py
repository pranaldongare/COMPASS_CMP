"""Importing a notice from the document legal wrote.

The cases that matter are the refusals. Anyone can write a happy path that
parses a good file; what decides whether this is safe to put in front of an R&D
User is what it does with a file that is nearly right - a token left unfilled, a
retention period written as prose, a notice that has already been published and
whose text is hashed into consents.

One case is load-bearing beyond parsing: **an import must not activate the
purposes it creates.** Activating a purpose is the DPO's act. If uploading a
document could produce active purposes, an R&D User would be approving their
own, and the DPO's review of the register would be a formality they could route
around with a file upload.
