    could lead back to the project it belongs to. Both are required fields, and
    four of the repository's six notice-row producers did not select them: the
    two list queries had no join to `project`, and the two write queries could
    not have one, because `RETURNING` cannot reach another table.

    failed query, which is why it looked like the notice had not been attached;
    the data principal's route has its own response model and never carried the
    project, which is why that one kept working and made it look like a
    permissions problem.
