# The audit trail

## What it guarantees

Every write to the platform records one entry, in the **same transaction** as the
change. A change that happened without an audit row is not a state the database
can reach.

## Append-only, four deep

1. No mutating route is registered on the resource.
2. The permission matrix grants no role write access.
3. `UPDATE` and `DELETE` are revoked from the application's database role
   (migration 0003).
4. A statement-level trigger refuses the statement (migration 0002).

Each layer alone would be a convention. Together they are a property.

## The hash chain

Each row carries a SHA-256 digest over its own canonical content **and its
predecessor's digest**.

Editing row N changes its digest, which no longer matches what N+1 recorded. So
verification does not answer "something changed" — it answers **"the trail is
sound up to exactly here"**, which is the answer somebody investigating actually
needs.

`GET /audit/verify` recomputes it. `cmp.maintenance.verify_audit_chain` runs it
daily, because a claim nobody checks is a claim nobody should believe.

Rows are chained in the order a transaction-level advisory lock is granted, and
since migration 0014 a row's `log_id` is drawn from the sequence *inside* that
lock rather than by a column default. The two orders are therefore one order,
which is what verification, walking by id, assumes. Before 0014, inserts
arriving together could carry ids in one order and predecessors in the other,
and verification reported a break that was not tampering. Rows written that way
stay as they are - the trail is append-only - and verification keeps naming the
first of them until the database is rebuilt.

## Reading it

The trail records `notice#42` — a table name and a surrogate key — because that
is the only reference guaranteed to stay valid. Codes get reused, projects get
renamed, people leave.

Precise, and unreadable. `db/repositories/entities.py` resolves the pair at read
time into a label, a public uuid and an in-app route: one query per entity type
on a page, never one per row. A row that no longer exists resolves to nothing
rather than an error — the trail outlives what it describes, and an evidence log
that fails to load because of one dangling reference is not a log.

## Denials are events too

`auth.access_denied` records a refused request with the reason. An access-control
system that refuses correctly but silently tells an operator nothing about
somebody probing, or a role provisioned wrongly.

## What is not in it

Credentials, one-time codes, consent link tokens, and the contents of a data
asset. The trail says *what was done to which record by whom*, not what the
record contained.
