NOTICE UNDER SECTION 5, DIGITAL PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION ACT 2023

Who is asking. Bharat Research Labs, acting as Data Fiduciary.

What we will collect. Your name, mobile number, and a facial image and short
gait video recorded at the collection site.

Why. To build and evaluate machine-learning models for gait-based
identification, and to verify the quality of the recordings we collect.

How long we keep it. Three years from the date of collection, after which the
recordings are erased.

Who else sees it. The recipients named at the end of this notice.

Your rights. You may ask for a summary of your data, ask us to correct or erase
it, nominate someone to act for you, and withdraw your consent. Withdrawing is
as easy as giving consent was. Withdrawal stops future processing; it does not
by itself delete recordings already made - ask for erasure if that is what you
want.

If you are not satisfied. Contact our Data Protection Officer first. You may
also complain to the Data Protection Board of India, independently of us.
