"""Sending an email, as the rest of the system sees it.

One object with one job: take a template's output and hand it to whatever
transport this environment is configured for. Callers name a message
(`send_mfa_code`), never a transport.

The service is deliberately thin. Retry, backoff and queue routing belong to
Celery and live in `cmp.tasks`; putting them here would mean two retry policies
disagreeing about how many attempts is too many.
