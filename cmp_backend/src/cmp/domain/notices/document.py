"""Reading a notice out of the document the lawyers wrote.

A notice arrives as a Word file. Somebody in legal owns its wording, and the
wording is the part that must survive unaltered - so this module reads that file
rather than asking an R&D User to retype it into a form, which is how a notice
and the document it was approved as drift apart.

The document is parsed, never interpreted. Three tables carry the structure:

  Table 0   the header block, `Field | Value`
  Table A   the data categories, DC-01..DC-07
  Table B   one purpose per row

and everything else is prose that becomes the rendition a data principal reads.

**Nothing here touches the database.** `parse` takes bytes and returns a
description of what the document says, or raises with the cell that is wrong.
That split is what makes the dry run honest: the validate endpoint runs exactly
this code and then stops, so what it reports is what an import would do rather
than a second implementation that agrees with the first until it doesn't.

Two rules are worth stating because they are refusals rather than defaults:

**A surviving `{{TOKEN}}` fails the import.** The document is filled in before
upload. A notice served with `{{PARTNER_NAME}}` still in it is worse than no
notice at all - it is a legal document that visibly nobody read.

**Every field the register requires must be in the document.** `purpose` has
eight NOT NULL columns with no default. Guessing at a lawful basis or an erasure
trigger would put an assumption nobody stated into the row that decides when
personal data gets deleted, so the columns are required and the parse fails
loudly when they are absent.

    rendition beside an existing one instead of replacing it, and a notice would
    quietly carry the same language twice.

    dash or comma; a bare code resolves through the map below; a region suffix
    is dropped, because a rendition is a language, not a locale.

    A language this platform does not store is refused here, by name and with

    instead, as a 500 the uploader could do nothing about.
