"""Notice authoring and publication.

Publication is the moment the platform makes a promise it must keep. In one
transaction it validates every Rule 3 element, generates `recipients_text` from
the project's sites, computes a sha256 per language rendition, and marks the
notice published. After that the text is immutable - the database refuses an edit
(migration 0002) and this module offers no path to one.

`content_hash` is what makes INV-4 work. Each consent artefact copies the hash of
the exact rendition served, so "show me what she agreed to" is answerable from
the artefact alone, and a later correction cannot silently repoint her record at
words she never saw.
