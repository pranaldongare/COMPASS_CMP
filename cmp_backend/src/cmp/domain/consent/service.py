"""The consent flow - capture, withdrawal, and the link that carries them.

The rules that make an artefact evidence rather than a row:

* **The subject comes from the session, never from the request body.** There is
  no code path by which any role records consent for someone else.
* **`served_at <= affirmative_action_at`.** s.5(1): the notice must be given
  before or with the request for consent. A record where she acted before the
  text rendered is defective on its face, and the database refuses it.
* **The content hash is copied at capture.** Not referenced - copied. INV-4.
* **Withdrawal supersedes, never edits.** The old artefact stays exactly as it
  was; a new one points back at it. The chain is the record.
