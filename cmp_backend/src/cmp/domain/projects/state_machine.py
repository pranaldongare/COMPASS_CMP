"""The project state machine.

Four reachable states, five transitions, and nothing else. From DATA-MODEL.md:

| From                | To                 | Actor                   | Requires                                                        |
|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| -                   | `in_draft`         | RnD User                | name, description, >=1 processor                                |
| `in_draft`          | `pending_approval` | RnD User                | notice with >=1 purpose **every one of them activated**, all Rule 3 links, an audience, its text written, and >=1 project_approval **with proof file** |
| `pending_approval`  | `approved`         | DPO                     | every language legally approved, every purpose activated; publishes the notice |
| `pending_approval`  | `in_draft`         | DPO                     | a reason                                                        |
| `approved`          | `closed`           | DPO or a collection owner | -                                                             |

There is no path from `in_draft` to `approved`, and none back from `approved`
except to `closed`.

**Why `under_process` is gone.** It used to sit between the two states above, and
belonged to the DPO: the R&D User assembled a project, the DPO published its
notice, and only then could the R&D User attach the approval and submit. That put
a second person's step in the middle of one person's work, so a project waited on
somebody whose actual job - reviewing it - had not started yet. Assembly is now
one state, `in_draft`, and the DPO is asked once, at the end, when there is
something to review.

Publication moved with it. The notice goes live at `approved`, which is also when
it becomes true: a notice published before the project it describes was approved
was a promise made on behalf of a decision nobody had taken.

**Why legal approval of the text is not a submission requirement.** It was, and
it deadlocked: approving a language is the DPO's act, the author could not submit
without it, and the DPO does not see the project until it is submitted. Each side
was waiting for the other and nothing on either screen said so.

So the two halves are separated by who does them. The author writes the notice
and its text; the DPO approves that text and then approves the project. The check
did not go away - it moved to the gate in front of the person who can satisfy it,
where being blocked is actionable rather than circular.

`ProjectStatus.UNDER_PROCESS` survives as a value because
`project_status_history` rows still name it. Nothing transitions *to* it.

This module is pure: it takes a status, a role and a snapshot of facts, and
returns what is permitted. It touches no database and no request. That is what
lets `GET /projects/{uuid}/transitions` and `POST /projects/{uuid}/transition`
share one definition instead of drifting into two - and lets the whole table be
tested without a fixture.
