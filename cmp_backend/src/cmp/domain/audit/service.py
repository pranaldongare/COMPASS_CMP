"""The audit trail.

Built second, before any resource that writes. Retrofitting audit coverage across
a finished codebase means hand-checking every write path, and missing some.

Three rules this module exists to hold:

1. **Only services record.** A router that writes to the database bypasses the
   audit call; that is how audit trails end up patchy. `record()` takes the
   connection the service is already inside, so the audit row and the change it
   describes commit or roll back together. An audited change that rolled back is
   a lie, and a change that committed without its audit row is worse.

2. **`entity_type` is the table name, exactly.** Free text produces
   `consent_artefact`, `ConsentArtefact` and `consent` in the same column within a
   month, and the rights-request query then silently misses rows. The vocabulary
   below is closed and validated.

3. **Actor and subject are different people.** When a DCO runs an export the
   actor is the DCO and the subject is null. When a data subject withdraws, both
   are her. Confusing the two makes the DSAR query wrong in the direction that
   under-reports.
