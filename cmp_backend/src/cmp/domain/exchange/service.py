"""Exports and imports.

**Exports are two steps deliberately.** Generating writes the log and the line
rows; downloading is separate and repeatable. Regenerating to re-download would
write duplicate `export_line` rows and corrupt the disclosure record.

**One export, per project, as a CSV.** There were two and the split asked the
wrong question of the person using it: a JSON pack with the context and no
people, and a CSV with the people and no context. The agent at the collection
point needs both on the same row - whom the consent is against, and which notice
version they agreed to - and was joining two files by hand to get it.

Every row carries the project, the notice and the site alongside the person, so
it opens in a spreadsheet and filters without preparation. Consented, partial
and withdrawn rows are included with a status column; a withdrawal is the row an
agent most needs to see, and it is invisible on a consented-only list.

**Imports are idempotent.** Rows upsert on (source, source_reference).
Re-submitting the same file accepts nothing and reports zero. `validate` is a dry
run - same parsing, same checks, nothing written - because a manifest arriving
from a third-party tool is the input you trust least, and finding out after a
partial write is worse than finding out before.
