"""Delivering the codes somebody is waiting for.

All four route to `high_priority`, and that queue exists for exactly this.
Somebody is looking at a code entry box right now; a code queued behind a
document export is a failed sign-in and a support call.

These use `dispatch_required`, not `dispatch_optional` — if the broker is
unreachable the request fails with a 503 rather than returning 200 and leaving
the user waiting for a message that will never arrive.
