"""Queuing a task, and deciding what happens when the broker is unreachable.

The naive `task.delay(...)` inside a request handler couples the endpoint's
availability to the broker's. That is right for some work and badly wrong for
most, so the choice is made explicitly per call site rather than by accident:

* `dispatch_required` - the task *is* the outcome. An MFA code that was never
  queued means the user cannot sign in, so the honest answer is 503 with a
  message telling them to try again, not a 500 that reads like a bug.

* `dispatch_optional` - the task is a side effect of something that already
  succeeded. A consent artefact is written and committed; failing the request
  because the receipt could not be queued would tell the user their consent was
  not recorded, which is false, and would invite them to submit it again.

  "Already succeeded" is taken literally: inside a unit of work the queueing is
  deferred until the transaction commits (`cmp.core.after_commit`), so a worker
  cannot act on a row that is not yet visible and a rollback sends nothing.

Both log. A dropped notification that nobody can see is the failure mode this
module exists to prevent.
