"""Celery application.

Architecture: FastAPI -> producer -> Redis broker -> worker -> task -> database or
external service.

Every setting below is a decision about what happens when something fails, and
the defaults Celery ships with are wrong for work that touches personal data:

* `task_acks_late=True` - acknowledge *after* the task succeeds, not on receipt.
  If a worker is killed mid-task the message is redelivered rather than lost.
  The cost is at-least-once delivery, which is why every task here is idempotent.
* `task_reject_on_worker_lost=True` - the same guarantee for a hard kill.
* `worker_prefetch_multiplier=1` - a worker takes one task at a time. The default
  of 4 lets one slow worker hoard a queue while its neighbours idle.
* `task_time_limit` and `soft_time_limit` - a task with no time limit is a worker
  slot that can be lost permanently.
* `broker_transport_options.visibility_timeout` must exceed the longest task, or
  Redis redelivers a task that is still running and it executes twice.

Queues are separated by latency requirement, not by subject matter. An OTP email
that queues behind a report is a sign-in the user gave up on.
