"""Constrained text types.

Every string crossing the API boundary is one of these, never a bare `str`. The
constraint travels with the type, so a field cannot be added to a model without
somebody deciding how long it may be — which is the whole point: an unbounded
string field is a memory-exhaustion vector and a database error waiting for the
first user who pastes a document into a name box.

Bounds are chosen from what the column actually holds, not rounded to a
comfortable number. Where a bound here disagrees with the schema, the schema
wins and this file is wrong.
