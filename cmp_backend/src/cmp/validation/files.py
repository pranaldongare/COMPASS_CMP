"""Upload validation.

Two upload paths exist — an approval proof and an import manifest — and both are
input we trust least: one arrives from a researcher's laptop, the other from a
third-party capture tool.

Checks run in this order, and the order is the point: refuse on declared size
before reading, refuse on actual size before hashing, refuse on type before
parsing. Each step is cheaper than the one it protects.
