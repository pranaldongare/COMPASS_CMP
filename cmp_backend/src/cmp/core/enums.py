"""The database's vocabulary, in Python.

Twenty-five PostgreSQL enum types define what values the columns will accept.
This module mirrors them so the application can name a value without spelling it
as a string literal in forty places — and so a typo is an `AttributeError` at
import rather than a constraint violation at 3am.

**The database is the authority.** Every member here corresponds to a label in
the corresponding `CREATE TYPE`, in the same order. If the two disagree, this
file is wrong and the fix is here, not a migration. `tests/unit/core/test_enums.py`
asserts the correspondence against a live server so the drift cannot go unnoticed.

`StrEnum` throughout: the members compare equal to their labels, so a value read
from a row or bound into a query needs no conversion, and `use_enum_values=True`
on the response bases serialises them as the plain string a client expects.
