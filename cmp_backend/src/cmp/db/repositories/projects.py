"""project, project_status_history, project_approval, project_site.

Row scope lives here, in the WHERE clause, because that is the only place it is
real. `scope_predicate` is applied to every read a scoped caller can reach:

* DPO       - every row.
* DCO / RCO - projects deploying a data source they own (read), and projects
              whose primary site is theirs (write). See `scope_predicate`.
* DCO Admin - every project collected by a third party, read and write. Their
              job is to route those, and a router that cannot see the queue
              cannot do it.
* RnD User  - projects they created.
* Admin     - none. Administrators manage accounts, not collections.

A caller outside scope gets no row, which surfaces as 404. That is deliberate:
403 would confirm the project exists.

    the source-ownership model:

    * **Read** — any project with an active site they run, whether that is
      through owning its source or through being named on the site itself. A
      campus lead who runs one of a study's three locations has to be able to
      see the study.
    * **Write** — only projects whose *primary* site is theirs, which is what
      `project.dco_user_id` holds (kept in step by `trg_site_owner` and
      `trg_source_owner`). One owner acts; the others watch their own sources.

    An **RCO** is the same shape. The role name records that they are accountable
    for collection the R&D team does itself rather than for a third party's, and
    that distinction lives on the processor - not in who may see what. Giving them
    a separate predicate would be two copies of one rule.

    A **DCO Admin** is not that shape at all, so it is answered before the scope
    lookup: they hold every third-party project, read and write, because routing
    them is the job.

    Passing `write=True` for a read is harmless and merely narrow. Passing it the
    other way round is not, which is why the default is the strict one.
