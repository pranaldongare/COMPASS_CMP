"""Resolving `(entity_type, entity_id)` into something a person can read.

The audit trail records what was touched as a table name and a surrogate key,
because that is the only reference guaranteed to stay valid: a notice code can be
reused, a project renamed, a user deleted from a directory. `notice#42` is
precise and permanent, and completely useless to the person reading the screen.

This module is the bridge. It takes the pairs a page of audit rows contains and
returns, for each, a label, the public uuid, and where in the product it lives -
so "Notice published" becomes "NTC-GAIT-2026 v1" with a link to the notice, and
the DPO can see *what* was published without running a query by hand.

Two rules hold throughout:

* **One query per entity type, never one per row.** A page of 25 rows touching
  four tables costs four queries, not twenty-five.
* **A row that no longer exists resolves to nothing, not to an error.** The audit
  trail outlives what it describes; a deleted source must not make the whole page
  fail to load.
