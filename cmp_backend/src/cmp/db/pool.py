"""Async connection pool and the unit of work.

Repositories never open a connection. They receive one, already inside the
transaction the service opened. That is what makes "publish a notice" one atomic
operation instead of four writes that can half-succeed.

Session-level `statement_timeout` and `lock_timeout` are set on every checkout.
A query with no timeout is a query that can hold a lock until the pool starves.
