"""Correlation id and audit context.

The first middleware entered, and it has to be: everything after it — including
the failure of anything after it — needs somewhere to record which request it
was. A traceback with no request id is a traceback nobody can match to the
support ticket that produced it.

The id is bound to a contextvar rather than passed as an argument, because the
alternative is threading it through four hundred function signatures to reach
the one log line at the bottom that needs it.

A client-supplied `X-Request-ID` is honoured so a caller can correlate across
systems, but it is sanitised and bounded first — it reaches a log line, and an
unbounded client-controlled string in a log line is log injection.
