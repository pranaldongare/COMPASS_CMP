"""Version 1 of the authenticated API.

Every route here requires a session, and every one names its guard in its
signature — a route with no guard is a route that is open, and that should be
visible on the line that declares it rather than inferred from its absence.

Versioned as a package rather than a URL prefix. The paths are unprefixed today
because the console is the only client and ships with the API; when a second
client exists, a `v2` package can carry changed contracts while `v1` keeps
serving the first one, and the mount point is one line in `bootstrap.routers`.
