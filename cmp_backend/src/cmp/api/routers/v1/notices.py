"""Notices - the R&D User authors, the DPO reviews and may correct, all roles read.

`/checklist` returns exactly what is blocking publication, so the UI shows a list
rather than a failed submit. It is readable by anybody who can read the notice,
because the person being blocked is usually the author, not the DPO.

Assembly belongs to the author - the notice, its purposes, its languages, and
any Rule 3 narrowing. Approving a language and publishing stay with the DPO:
those are the review, and an author who could sign off their own text would make
the review a formality.

`/publish` runs in one transaction: validate all Rule 3 elements, generate
`recipients_text` from the project's sites, compute `content_hash` per language,
set published. After this the text is immutable; edits create a new version.

# Two steps, like the manifest importer: a dry run that reports what the file
# says and writes nothing, then the import. Both run the same parse, so the
# preview is a rehearsal rather than a second opinion.
