    A source carries its own owner, so choosing CIT for a site is choosing

    them. `trg_site_owner` re-derives `project.dco_user_id` from the primary
    site on commit, and the project appears in that owner's list.

    * a **DCO Admin** on a project collected by a third party - that queue is

    * the **R&D owner** on one collected in-house, which is where an approved
      project goes back to them to name the sources and an RCO;
    * a **DPO** or **administrator** anywhere, for correction.

    themselves somebody else's project, or drop one they no longer want.
