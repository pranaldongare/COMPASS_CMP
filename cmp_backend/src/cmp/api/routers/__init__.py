"""Router registry.

`ROUTERS` is the order routes are registered, which is also the order they are
matched. One placement is load-bearing: the **public** routers come before the
authenticated ones, so `/c/{token}` can never be shadowed by a path parameter on
another router.

The rest of the order is grouped for reading — identity, then the registry, then
the project lifecycle, then oversight — and nothing depends on it.
