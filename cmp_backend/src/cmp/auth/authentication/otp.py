"""One-time codes, for data-subject sign-in, staff MFA and the public consent flow.

Properties that matter, and why:

* **The code is never stored.** Redis holds a keyed digest. A dump of the store
  does not let anyone complete a sign-in that is in flight.
* **The scope is part of the digest.** A code issued for a consent link cannot be
  replayed against `/auth/otp/verify`, because a different scope hashes to a
  different value even for the same six digits.
* **Attempts are counted against the code, not the connection.** Five wrong
  guesses discard the code (API reference §1.6). Counting per connection means
  an attacker with two connections gets ten.
* **Verification is single-use and atomic.** The delete happens with the check,
  so two racing requests cannot both succeed with the same code.

Six digits is a million-space, which is only safe *because* of the attempt cap
and the ten-minute lifetime. Neither control is optional.
