"""The things a permission can be about.

Seventeen names, each corresponding to one row of the API reference's permission
tables. They are strings rather than an enum for one reason: a route names its
resource inline — `RequireResource("project")` — and an enum member there would
be noise without adding safety, because `verify_resources()` below checks the
whole set at import.

**A resource absent from this module is denied to everyone.** That is the
default, and it is why adding an endpoint for something new fails closed rather
than open.
