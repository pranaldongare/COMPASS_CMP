/**
 * End-to-end: the public consent flow.
 *
 * These run in a real browser because the things being tested only exist in one:
 * the HttpOnly session cookie the client cannot read, the double-submit CSRF
 * header, and the multi-step state of the consent journey.
 *
 * They need a running API and a seeded consent link:
 *
 *   E2E_CONSENT_TOKEN=<token from scripts/seed.py> npx playwright test
 *
 * Without the token the link-dependent tests skip rather than fail — a suite
 * that goes red because a fixture is missing trains people to ignore red.
