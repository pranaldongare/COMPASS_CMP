/**
 * A data principal stays on her own side of the product.
 *
 * Reported: opening Notifications as a data subject led to an admin screen. The
 * feed itself was correct — her own events and nothing else — but every row
 * carried a link resolved for staff, and her registration event resolved to
 * `/users`, the administrator's account register.
 *
 * Two things are tested because there were two faults: the link is no longer
 * offered, and the page no longer renders if something else produces the URL.
